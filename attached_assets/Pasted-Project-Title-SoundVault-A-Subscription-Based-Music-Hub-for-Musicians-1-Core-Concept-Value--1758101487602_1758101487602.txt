Project Title: SoundVault - A Subscription-Based Music Hub for Musicians

1. Core Concept & Value Proposition:
SoundVault is a web application designed exclusively for musicians to store,manage, and showcase their music catalog. Unlike public streaming services, it acts as a private, professional vault and portfolio. Its unique value is ensuring only active, serious musicians maintain their accounts through a modest quarterly maintenance fee.

2. Core Features (The Must-Haves):

· User Authentication & Profiles:
  · Secure musician registration and login.
  · Artists can create and customize a personal profile (bio, photo, genre, links to social media/streaming services).
· Music Upload & Management Dashboard:
  · A clean, intuitive dashboard for users to view and manage all their uploaded tracks.
  · Support for high-quality audio file uploads (MP3, WAV, FLAC).
  · For each track, musicians can add rich metadata: Title, Artist, Album, Genre, Release Year, Producer Credits, Featured Artists, Lyrics (optional), and a cover art thumbnail.
  · Ability to edit metadata and delete tracks.
· Subscription & Payment System (The Core Business Logic):
  · All new accounts get a 14-day free trial to explore the platform.
  · After the trial, a recurring subscription fee of 100 NAD (Namibian Dollars) is required every 3 months (quarterly).
  · Integrated Payment Gateway: Secure integration with a payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle NAD transactions seamlessly.
  · Account Status Monitoring:
    · Active: Can upload, stream, and manage music. Payment is current.
    · Grace Period (7 days): Payment is overdue. User receives warnings but can still access their account to make the payment.
    · Suspended: After the grace period, account access is restricted. They cannot upload new music or stream their existing tracks. Their profile and music are not deleted.
    · Reactivation: A suspended user can reactivate their account by paying the overdue fee. Upon payment, full access is immediately restored.
· Music Player & Portfolio View:
  · A sleek, built-in audio player for musicians to play their own uploaded music directly from their dashboard.
  · A "Public Portfolio" page: A shareable link (e.g., soundvault.app/artist-name) that showcases their profile and music. This is perfect for sending to labels, venues, or collaborators.

3. Advanced & "Nice-to-Have" Features (To Make It Stand Out):

· Private Sharing & Collaboration:
  · Generate private, shareable links for individual tracks or albums. Perfect for getting feedback from producers or bandmates before official release.
  · Add password protection or expiration dates to private links.
· Analytics (Basic Insights):
  · For each track, show the number of plays on the Public Portfolio page.
  · In the dashboard, show which tracks are most popular and where your portfolio visitors are coming from (geography).
· Admin Panel:
  · A secure backend for you (the admin) to view all users, monitor subscriptions, and manage payments.
· Notifications & Reminders:
  · Email Automation:
    · Welcome email after signup.
    · Subscription reminder 7 days before renewal.
    · Payment confirmation receipt.
    · Grace period warning email.
    · Account suspension notification.
